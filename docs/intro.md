# Intro

Let's discover the API ***If you are here I can say you thanks to help me to realise this project***.

## Getting Started

Get started by **[download the project ](https://github.com/)**.


### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 16.14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.
- [React skills](https://react.com) 
  - You need know react and its particularities (i do not use redux)

## Generate the dependencies
Just use  : 

```bash
cd the-project
npm i@latest
```

## Start the site

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
